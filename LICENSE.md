## Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and the public can rely upon. The following considerations for the public also apply to creators and the public should follow them in order to make use of the licensed material.

1. **Public License Considerations:** A Creative Commons public license is a public agreement that grants certain permissions to the public, subject to certain conditions. If these conditions are not met, then use is not authorized by the licensor.

2. **No endorsement:** Creative Commons public licenses do not grant permissions to use the licensed material in a way that suggests any official status or that the licensor endorses you or your use.

3. **No warranties:** Creative Commons licenses do not provide warranties. Users must rely on their own legal analysis for all uses not explicitly granted.
